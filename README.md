# React realtime Chat

I built this example with [younesmln](https://github.com/younesmln) because we were struggling on how to integrate [socket.io-client](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client) with React/Redux application Using [Redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) [Channels](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/advanced/Channels.html) 

This example use :
  * redux
  * react router v4
  * redux saga

For the backend we used [Nodejs](https://github.com/nodejs/node) [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) with [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

# Run App
    
### Back-End
`cd Back-End && yarn start `

### Front-End
`cd Front-End && yarn start `
